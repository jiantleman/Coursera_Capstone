Singaporeans are obsessed with eating, and take pride in the fact that Singapore is a gastronomic heaven with both delicious local cuisine and world-class international fares. Internationally, Singapore is also well-known for its food, especially its local hawker cuisine, and food is a major tourist attraction in the country. \n* This project seeks to use location data to determine the neighborhood in Singapore with the best food. This information has several useful applications for different target audiences:\n    * Tourists who are foodies can find places to stay that will give them easy access to the best food, or find neighborhoods that they can visit for a one-stop food trial\n    * Considering the importance of food nationally, Singaporeans can use the information as an additional metric when they are considering where to move and stay"
